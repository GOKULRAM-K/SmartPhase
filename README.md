## 🌍 Overview

Kerala’s energy infrastructure is evolving — and with it comes the challenge of ensuring **efficient, balanced, and intelligent power distribution** across every region.  
Our solution, the **Smart Phase Balancing and Hybrid IoT Power Distribution System**, redefines how transformers and homes communicate, coordinate, and optimize electricity delivery.

This project builds a **self-learning, hybrid IoT architecture** that connects every household node and transformer to a central intelligence layer — providing **real-time visibility**, **load balancing**, and **automated control** across both **urban and rural** grids.

It’s more than just monitoring — it’s about creating a power network that can *sense, decide, and act*.

---

> ⚡ **Built for Scalability. Designed for Security. Engineered for Real-Time Performance.**

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Kerala’s power grid spans a complex mix of **dense city networks, campuses, and rural terrains**.  
While urban regions are data-rich, rural and hilly areas still lack connectivity — resulting in **phase imbalance, transformer overloads, and manual dependency.**

Our system ensures that *no matter the terrain*, **every node, every transformer, and every watt of energy** is monitored, managed, and optimized.  
This architecture directly supports **KSEB’s vision for a Smart, Connected Kerala**, integrating renewable energy and improving grid resilience.

---

### 🚀 What Makes It Different

| Feature | Traditional Grid | Our Smart Grid |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Phase Monitoring | Manual, delayed | Real-time IoT sensing |
| Control | Manual switchovers | Automated balancing logic |
| Connectivity | Wired or single-channel | Hybrid (Cellular + LoRa + Wired) |
| Data Handling | Limited local logging | State-wide data ingestion & analytics |
| Scalability | Transformer-level | State-wide, modular, and scalable |
| Security | Minimal | TLS + AES + Role-Based Control |

> 🧠 *This isn’t just digitalization — it’s intelligence built into every transformer.*

---

## 💡 Core Objective

Our primary goal is to design a **modular, scalable, and cost-efficient hybrid IoT ecosystem** that enables smart, automated, and secure energy distribution.

### ✅ System Objectives

- Detect **phase imbalance and transformer overloads** automatically in real time.

</p>

> *Smart distribution starts at the transformer — but intelligence begins at every node.*

---

## 🔩 4. Hardware Architecture

Electricity distribution begins at the **transformer** and the **household node** — our design ensures that *intelligence is embedded at the point of action*.  
The system operates on a distributed model where each hardware layer — home node, transformer PI, and gateway — contributes to real-time balance, control, and reporting.

---

### 🏠 Home Node Unit

Each connected home is equipped with a **Smart Node Module**, built around low-cost yet reliable microcontrollers that can **measure, communicate, and act**.

**Key Components**
- ⚡ **Microcontroller:** Arduino or ESP32 for real-time control and data handling.  
- 🧲 **Sensors:** PZEM-004T or equivalent modules to measure current, voltage, and power factor.  
- 🔄 **3-Phase Relay Module:** Dynamically switches household load between phases under PI command.  
- 📡 **Communication Interface:** RS-485 (wired) or LoRa/Wi-Fi (wireless) for reliable connectivity.

**Functions**
- Constantly monitors power flow and sends updates to the transformer-level PI.  
- Switches phases autonomously when instructed or during local instability.  
- Can detect anomalies such as overcurrent or reverse feed from solar sources.  
- Capable of limited edge processing — reducing unnecessary communication load.

> 🧠 *Each home node acts as a “thinking endpoint” — small in size, big in intelligence.*

---

### 🧠 Transformer PI Unit

At the center of each transformer sits a **Raspberry Pi-based controller**, the real-time decision-maker of the network.

**Core Responsibilities**
- Aggregates readings from 50–100 connected home nodes.  
- Continuously evaluates **phase balance, load deviation, and power quality**.  
- Executes control signals to nodes for **instant phase reallocation**.

- **Local Storage:** Temporary SQLite buffer for outage resilience.  

> “Where traditional transformers stop at distribution — ours begins with intelligence.”

---

### 🧭 Gateway PI

In low-connectivity areas, a designated **Gateway PI** collects data from nearby PIs via LoRa and pushes it to the control center using a stronger cellular link.

- Acts as a **local data hub** for multiple transformers.  
- **Reduces SIM usage** and overall communication cost.  
- Ensures **complete coverage**, even in rural or hilly terrains.

---

> *Hardware built for field reality — rugged, scalable, and ready for automation.*

## 🔒 7. Security & Reliability Framework

In critical infrastructure like the power grid, **security and reliability are non-negotiable**.  
Our architecture embeds protection, resilience, and compliance **at every layer** — from field hardware to analytics servers.

This ensures that all data remains **authentic, encrypted, and tamper-proof**, while operations continue seamlessly even during outages or network fluctuations.

---

### 🧱 Layered Security Model

| Layer | Security Mechanism | Purpose |
|--------|--------------------|----------|
| **Communication** | TLS 1.3 Encryption | Secures data transmission between PI units and Control Center, preventing interception. |
| **Storage** | AES-256 Encryption | Protects data at rest within databases and logs, ensuring confidentiality and compliance. |
| **Access Control** | JWT + RBAC | Provides authenticated and role-based access for users and devices. |
| **Network** | VPN + Firewalls | Isolates the internal communication network, blocking unauthorized intrusion. |
| **Governance** | Audit Logging System | Tracks all configuration changes, access events, and control actions for traceability. |

> *Security is not an afterthought — it’s embedded by architecture.*

---

### 🧠 Why These Measures Matter

- **TLS 1.3:** Prevents data theft or man-in-the-middle attacks during communication.  
- **AES-256:** Ensures that even if storage is breached, data remains unreadable.  
- **JWT Authentication:** Blocks unauthorized logins and protects sensitive control APIs.  
- **RBAC:** Limits user operations — only authorized roles can trigger control actions.  
- **VPN & Firewalls:** Shield the network backbone from external interference.  
- **Audit Logs:** Enable forensic tracing and compliance with KSEB cybersecurity norms.  

Together, these measures **prevent breaches, spoofing, and unauthorized command injection**, ensuring a **trusted and resilient network** for smart power control.

| **Edge Continuity Mode** | PI continues to balance load locally even when disconnected from the control center. |

> 🛠️ *The grid never sleeps — neither does its maintenance.*

---

### 📈 Data Retention & Lifecycle Management

To ensure long-term traceability and analytics potential, the system retains and manages data efficiently:

- **Live Operational Data:** Stored in TimescaleDB for 1 year.  
- **Archived Historical Data:** Moved to Data Lake (HDFS/NFS) after 12 months.  
- **Analytical Summaries:** Compressed and retained indefinitely for policy insights.  

This approach ensures **cost-efficiency, scalability, and analytical depth** — even over decades of operation.

---

> *Reliability isn’t achieved by redundancy alone — it’s designed into every process.*
